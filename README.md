This is a modpack designed for the Coatcraft 2 server, these are mods that are unable to be added to the main git from file size limits, so links to them will be placed here along with their name incase the link doesn't work.

If you have any questions about mods being added, or configs changed, msg me in the discord or make a pull request into the mods folder or a link here for the mod, i will test it with He Who to see if it is ok to add and is fine with the modpack, if not, i will explain why to you in dm's.
